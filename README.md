Finding suitable restaurants for people with different needs

About 25% of the population suffers from food allergies or food intolerance. Some common allergens include peanut, lactose, gluten, soy, shellfish and many more. For people with food allergies or food intolerance going out to eat can be troublesome and difficult. My idea is developing an app for restaurants rating with a focus on food allergies, creating a community where people can recommend places that are considerate toward these disabilities.
